    <dl>
        <dt>MEAN Stack</dt>
        <dd>A full-stack JavaScript framework comprising MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. Used for building dynamic web applications.</dd>

        <dt>MERN Stack</dt>
        <dd>Similar to MEAN but replaces Angular with React. Used for creating modern and efficient web applications.</dd>

        <dt>LAMP Stack</dt>
        <dd>Combines Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Python/Perl for web application development. Widely used for its versatility and open-source components.</dd>

        <dt>Ruby on Rails</dt>
        <dd>A web application framework that uses the Ruby programming language. Known for its simplicity and convention over configuration (CoC) approach.</dd>

        <dt>Python Django</dt>
        <dd>A high-level Python web framework that promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Ideal for building secure and maintainable web applications.</dd>

        <dt>ASP.NET</dt>

        <dt>MEVN Stack</dt>
        <dd>Another variation of MEAN, MEVN uses Vue.js as the frontend web framework instead of Angular.js. Over the years, Vue.js has grown in popularity. It incorporates the best features of Angular and React.
            Vue.js is easy to learn, delivers a clear programming style, and provides superb performance for web applications.</dd>

        <dt>Java</dt>
        <dd>Java is not as popular as it once was. It is popular for enterprise applications, but new projects tend to gravitate to newer and lighter-weight application stacks like Node.js and Python. Java is still heavily used and there are lots of Java developers all over the world.</dd>
